    "\n",
    "*But!!* We don't actually have to follow the recursion all the way down. Suppose we have something like \"4, 5, 1\". In the test input for Part 2, rule 4 requires a message beginning with a sub-message matching rule 1, which in turn is just the \"a\" rule. If the message I'm checking begins with a *b*, all the recursion in the world will never be able to produce the message since the first character is wrong. If it *isn't* wrong, I can strip it from the message, remove the first rule 1 instance and retry. Either I come to an empty message with no rules left to apply (the message could be generated with the starting rules) or I don't (the message could not be generated). Pipes just mean more forks, no big deal."
