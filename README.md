# Advent of Code 2020
Solution of small programming puzzles presented by the Advent of Code Calendar 2020.
I opted to solve all exercises in Python3 to get acquainted with the language, with special consideration for the Pandas library.
A spare time, ergo it won't be the best code ever, but I hope to solve them all.
